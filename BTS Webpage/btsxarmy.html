<h5>
    The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: Î∞©ÌÉÑÏÜåÎÖÑÎã®; Hanja: Èò≤ÂΩàÂ∞ëÂπ¥Âúò), literally meaning "Bulletproof Boy Scouts".
    According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets".
    In Japan, they are known as B≈çdan Sh≈çnendan (Èò≤ÂºæÂ∞ëÂπ¥Âõ£), which translates similarly.
    In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new brand identity.
    This extended their name to mean "growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward."
